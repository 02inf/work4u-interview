# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the existing React frontend application to be more development-friendly by removing Jest testing setup, implementing Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components using a yellow theme, and adding streaming chat functionality using fetchEventSource and ahooks for API requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove Jest testing dependencies and setup, so that I can use a different testing framework or approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN Jest dependencies SHALL be removed from package.json
2. WHEN the project is built THEN Jest configuration files SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the project is built THEN Jest-related test files SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the project is built THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without Jest dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components using a yellow theme, so that I can build a consistent and modern UI quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind CSS is installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Tailwind dependencies
2. WHEN shadcn/ui is configured THEN the system SHALL use a yellow-based color theme
3. WHEN shadcn/ui components are available THEN they SHALL be properly configured with the yellow theme
4. WHEN the application loads THEN Tailwind styles SHALL be applied correctly
5. WHEN shadcn/ui components are used THEN they SHALL render with the yellow theme consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement streaming chat functionality using fetchEventSource, so that I can handle real-time chat responses from a /chat API endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetchEventSource is installed THEN the system SHALL include the fetchEventSource dependency
2. WHEN a chat request is made THEN the system SHALL use fetchEventSource to connect to /chat endpoint
3. WHEN streaming data is received THEN the system SHALL handle Server-Sent Events properly
4. WHEN streaming is active THEN the UI SHALL update in real-time with incoming messages
5. WHEN streaming encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use ahooks useRequest for common AJAX requests, so that I can handle API calls with built-in loading states and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ahooks is installed THEN the system SHALL include the ahooks dependency
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use useRequest hook from ahooks
3. WHEN requests are in progress THEN loading states SHALL be properly managed
4. WHEN requests complete THEN success and error states SHALL be handled appropriately
5. WHEN requests fail THEN error handling SHALL be consistent across the application

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing React application structure to be preserved while integrating new dependencies, so that the core functionality remains intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN existing React components SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN Tailwind is integrated THEN existing CSS SHALL be migrated or replaced appropriately
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all core React functionality SHALL work as expected
4. WHEN building the project THEN the build process SHALL complete without errors
